# quality_issue_predictor

This is the seed idea for modeling the manfuacturing process based on components used to make predictions and/or 
identify manufacturing lots that maybe at risk of experiencing a quality issue.

See the document "Foresite 2020.pdf" for the Hackathon presentation.  The  presentation was a finalist in the 2021 Cardinal Health Hackathon.

The project is currently being revamped with more exploratory data analysis, better data collecting (via direct SQL queries), and model improvment.

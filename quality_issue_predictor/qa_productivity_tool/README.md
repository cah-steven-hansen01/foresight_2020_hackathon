One stop shop for Quality Record data

Manufacturing Quality Data comes from different sources (e.g. SmartSolve, BPCS) and to fully paramaterize quality records as many as three or more reports and sources are generally stiched together manually using 'cut/paste' and 'filtering' which can cause issues with transparency, accuracy and reliablity.  Additionally it's very time consuming 
and tedious. Due to this data was pulled anywhere from twice a week (for NC records) to every two weeks for complaint records which means the data being used may be out of date. This tool provides a fast, reliable and transparent way to access data.
